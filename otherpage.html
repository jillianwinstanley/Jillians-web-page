    <p>
      The purpose of this page has to do mainly with gymnastics. I am on the varisty gymnastics team here at GW. We are in the EAGL Conference which stands for East Atlantic Gymnastics League. The other schools in our conference are University of New Hampshire, Pittsburgh, Towson, NC State and University of North Carolina. Last year, we were the EAGL Conference Champions as a team, for the first time in GW school history. We also qualified to the NCAA Regional tournament as a team for the first time since 2002.
