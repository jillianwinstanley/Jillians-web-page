    <h1>Here is my third page!</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of this page is to talk a little bit more about my academics and what I involve myself in at GW. I am a sophomore in the Business School studying Finance with a minor in Spanish. I am also a University Justice here on campus. University Justices is a branch of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. We hear cases from students who have broken the GW Code of Student Conduct,encourage students to think about how their actions affect not only themselves, but the entire GW community and work one-on-one with the student or in small groups (a few justices to one student) to hear about their decision making and why they have consequentially been found in violation of the Code of Student Conduct. In doing so, we talk with them about the incidents they were involved in to identify what happened and why it happened, so that we can act as a fair and objective voice in recommending what subsequent steps should be taken. In the end, we may recommend appropriate educational courses (perhaps on drugs/alcohol) or resources on campus (Haven, counseling center) for students to use to talk through and be educated on how they may learn from what happened in order to progress towards being an individual that appropriately abides by and represents the ideals that are so important to us all here at GW.
